        <h2>Combat</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="commands.png" alt="Commands" style="width: 200px; height: 200px; float: right; margin-left: 10px;"> 
            Level the playing field with an Efon's Droids sturdy combat droid with a great health pool and solid damage output. You can use a droid with a combat level (CL) up to 5 levels higher than you (e.g. you can use a CL60 droid at level 55). Many of our models also feature such combat specials as self-shielding (Droideka Shield) or repair (Regenerative Plating), or special attacks like Electric Shocker, Flame Jet, Rapid Discharge Battery and/or Torture Panel. Don't be caught without your personal droid bodyguard! NOTE: DROIDS CAPPED AT CL60 FOR COMBAT CLASSES (90s will keep abilities but automatically reset to 60).
        </p>
        
        <p>Using a droid in combat is as simple as calling it from your datapad or toolbar. You can set your droid to group with you (so you can monitor health) and guard you (so it will attack anything that attacks you) using the following macro (where xx is the toolbar slot your droid is and yy is an toolbar slot with any other command you want to setup to start):
        </p>
<pre>
/ui action toolbarSlotxx;
/pause 2;
/tellpet guard;
/pause 1;
/tellpet group;
/pause 1;
/ui action toolbarSlotyy;
</pre>
        
        <p>The above macro assumes that you haven't changed the voice commands for guard and group. If you have, simply match the macro to your droid command (see radial menu > Program). You can also just drag the Droid - Guard command onto your toolbar and click that after calling the droid if you don't want to deal with macros.</p>

Once the command is inserted into the flight computer/astromech, the chip is destroyed.
